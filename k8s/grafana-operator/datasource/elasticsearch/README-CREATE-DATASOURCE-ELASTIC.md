    Pattern: No pattern ( Daily )
    Time field name: @timestamp

Warnig:
1. Communication with elasticsearch is working
2. Grafana does not recognize the field (@timestamp) automaticaly generated by elasticsearch
Probably the field which indicates the time should be defined explicity in the index pattern.
